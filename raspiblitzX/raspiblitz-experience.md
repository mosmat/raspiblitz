# Raspiblitz Experience

The purpose of this directory is to give place to creative work neither consolidated as a matter of front nor back-end development. Primarily, it can be considered just as user feedback, however is intended to provide resources that might be useful at the scope project; specially -and enthusiastically- regarding the current [raspiblitz-web repo.](https://github.com/cstenglein/raspiblitz-web) (Jul 2021)

## So, this is about design... with extra steps?

Yes and no. When it comes to *experience,* that ambiguity is a feature, rather than a bug. [^1] 

Objective resources in this folder might be [DTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing) mostly. Its contents are intended to carry some kind of *projectual ethos* that might address decision making scope regarding issues widening both back and front-end development; as well as user/public communication.

### Resources might be, but are not limited to:

    - Texts
    - Diagrams
    - Presentations
    - Moodboards
    - Gifs
    - Infographics
    - Memes

## Why is needed?

Discussion, same as the project, is open. Design guidelines are already being discussed in other communal projects such as [bitcoindesign.](https://bitcoin.design/guide/) These can be useful for automation and etiquette; however Raspiblitz *textuality* characteristic would be lacking if template-only procedures would to be applied. Raspiblitz *legibility* might be handy for creative workers such as illustrators and memelords. 

### This approach could somehow resume the categories:

| UX | Description | |
| - | - | - |
| Previous X | User assumptions about the project and its recognition. | *What does Raspiblitz solves and why do I need it?* |
| Whilst X | Meeting the project/product and getting used to it. | *Going into an adventure. Choose your type and level up.* |
| Post X | Recognizing it as own. Talking about it and contributing to it. | *Towards layer 2 habitability.*  | 
## How collaboration works with this approach?

The content of the resources are intended to be grounded in the *dynamic tension* of relationships between body(users) and world(nodes). [^2] That being said, some kind of minutiae regarding both devs and users approaches might be needed; although chats, live-streams, threads and comments are much of what could be needed for the record matter.

## Task list as Jul-21
